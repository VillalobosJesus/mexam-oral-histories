## About The Mexican American Heritage and History Museum
The Mexican American Heritage and History Museum is dedicated to preserving, promoting, and celebrating the people and histories of the founding cultures of Tucson and the Pimería Alta. Through exhibits and programming, we showcase, educate, and commemorate the rich heritage, culture, and contributions of Southern Arizona’s Mexican American and Tucsonense communities.

## About The Sosa-Carrillo House
Constructed circa 1878, the Sosa-Carrillo House embodies a rich history preserved within its original adobe walls. The Carrillo family occupied the home for over 90 years, until the era of Urban Renewal. In 2018, Betty Villegas and Patricia Benton partnered with Los Descendientes del Presidio de Tucson to propose the establishment of the Mexican American Heritage and History Museum. The historic house reopened in 2019 with its inaugural exhibit, "Trailblazing Women of Mariachi Music."

## About cb-oralhistory
**cb-oralhistory** is a mix of [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv) and [Oral History as Data (OHD)](https://github.com/oralhistoryasdata/oralhistoryasdata.github.io). It's meant to serve as a starter repository for those wanting to build oral history collections with CollectionBuilder. 

The current demo site features a small mix of transcripts. Item pages are generated by a CSV metadata file that includes the display_template "transcript" as a field. 

## About Oral History as Data
Oral History as Data (OHD) provides a static web framework for users to publish and analyze coded oral history and qualitative interviews on the web. 

Oral History as Data was first built in 2018, coming out of work at the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CD?L)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). 
The framework served as the foundation for several digital humanities projects, including [Voices of Gay Rodeo](https://www.voicesofgayrodeo.com/), [Idaho Queered](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/queered/), and [CTRL+Shift](https://ctrl-shift.org/). 

The look for OHD is different than CollectionBuilder. Check out the [a demo site](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/) to see the differences.

There is some [documentation](https://oralhistoryasdata.github.io/about.html#documentation) for OHD that might be helpful in this context. More fully developed documentation for this project is being developed, but there are several places linked here to get you started.
