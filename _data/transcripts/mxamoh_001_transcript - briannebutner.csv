[0:00],Brianne Butner,"Brianne Butner, B, R, I, E, A, N, N, E, last name, B, U, T, T, N, E, R. I was born September 27 of 1987 in San Diego, California, actually. But my family is from Pilares de Nacozari, Sonora, Mexico, and Clifton, Arizona.",,,
,Aengus Anderson,"Okay, I was just talking to some Morenci folks.",,,
,BB,"Yep. Other town. It's right there, but yeah.",,,
,AA,It's good to know. ,,,
,BB,"Yes. The mine is Morenci and then yeah, the town is Clifton.",,,
,AA,So I am recording really whatever we want to talk about. ,,,
,BB,Great.,,,
,AA,But do you already have something in mind?,,,
,BB,I do.,,,
,AA,"Well, in that case, it's really easy. What do you have in mind?",,,
[0:47],BB,"So my father's family came through Tucson, part of the Buttner family, so that's the little story I wanted to be recorded. Because the story that I was told is that my great-great-grandfather, Adolph Butner, was the first police commissioner of Tucson in the late 1800s.",family history;,,
,AA,Really?,,,
,BB,"Yeah, that's what I was told. So he immigrated from when he was a child, from Germany, I think from Prussia, because it was still Prussia. So from that area to the United States as a child, and then he made his way west as he grew up. And so the story is that he served in the Union Army, and then he came farther west and became a scout for the army, which is kind of controversial, and then eventually made his way to Tucson, and then became the first police commissioner of Tucson, before he died in his 30s, and he had a bunch of kids, so he married a Sonoran woman, and his children married Sonoran women, so they grew up Speaking Spanish, but he was born and raised in Germany. I don't know if he spoke German, but he died. And the story is that he was given, and there's a newspaper article I've read that he was given, when he was police commissioner, a gold badge that said Buttner on it. I've yet to ever see it. I don't know what happened to it.",,,
,AA,Somewhere.,,,
,BB,"It might be somwhere. Maybe it got melted down at this point, but I was hoping, when I moved here about 12 years ago, to find the story and to find the the evidence. But yeah, so my father grew up in Clifton to you know, his grandfather and father worked in mines. On my mother's side, her father worked in mines, and then they met in San Diego, and I was born there. ",,,
,AA,"Oh, wow. Okay.",,,
,BB,But then I came back.,,,
,AA,What drew you back to Tucson?,,,
[02:50],BB,"I came to U of A to get my teaching credential with Teach Arizona program. It's the shortest program. It's one year. But I also I grew up coming to Arizona, visiting my family in Safford and Clifton, and so I loved Arizona, and I wanted to live here, and then I just stayed.",,,
,AA,That's really cool. What is it like to move back to a place where you have this strange connection to like this guy who served as the first police commissioner?,,,
[03:19],BB,"It's really cool. I mean, I'm a historian. I'm a history teacher in TUSD and so I love, you know, learning about my family's history and history in general. So, you know, when I first moved here, it was this amazing feeling of like, I didn't grow up coming here, because we would just drive right through here and go on to Clifton. But it was like I felt like I had been here before, you know, walking the streets, especially the old streets in downtown, knowing like, you know, my ancestors had had lived here and walked around here and done business here. My best friend, Alicia Vasquez, who helped put this event together, her great, great grandfather was the carriage maker. And I was like, what if they knew at you, they probably knew each other.",,,
,AA,"Oh, they knew each other.",,,
,BB,"If they were around the same time, like, they definitely knew each other, you know. So that just, it was amazing. And probably part of the reason I stayed just, you know, it wasn't a place that was random or that it didn't have any roots in, you know, I felt like, I was like, okay, I'm supposed to be here. So it comes in really handy, or, like, it's really special when I'm teaching, because then the students can have that same kind of experience of knowing that, like, when we talk about local history, how important our family's history is, and you know, this event recording our family's history, it's because, like, we're a part of history. So that's kind of my whole mission. And point when I teach is like, we're a part of history too. You know, it's not just something that happened to other people somewhere else. It's our families. And so when they own that, they become much more like animated and encouraged to learn and place themselves in history. Me. So that's what I felt like when I moved here. I was like, wow. Like, you know, all the things that happened, somebody that I knew was around during that time, you know, like during mine, strikes and organizing and, you know, big events and floods and all sorts of stuff. Like, we were there trying to find where my ancestors house was. I don't think it doesn't exist anymore, because I think, I think downtown grew over it, but things like that, you know, it really made everything much more real and special.",,,
,AA,That's very cool. ,,,
,BB,Thank you.,,,
[05:31],AA,"I wanted to ask, you know, just because I'm always curious of how different places perceive each other. So from, have you ever heard anything from like, family members of lore, of like, how do people in the Clifton-Morenci metropolitan area, if I can conflate them togerth, how do they see Tucson?",,,
,BB,"Oh, it's the big city. It still is even now. So I still have family there. And so, you know, anytime they come to visit or pass through, like, gotta stop at Costco. You got to fill up, you know.",,,
,AA,I it the loved or the hated big city? Or the both?,,,
,BB,It's more of the beloved big city. Phoenix is more of the hated big city. ,paper; between,,
,AA,"Okay, I was curious.",paper; between,,
,BB,"We have family there. And, yeah, I hate Phoenix too. But, you know, they Susan is, is more of like, Yeah, I think it's more love, because people are still friendly here, and there's still a small town feel, whereas Phoenix is just, yeah, literally, the metropolitan but, yeah, it's though it's still the big city. And when we talk about it, you know? And I go back and people are like, Oh, are you know? Oh, you live in Tucson, the big city, yeah. So that's really fun. And my children are both born here.",paper; between,,
,AA,"Cool, they're Tucsonans.",paper; between,,
,BB,"Yes, they are.",paper; between,,

,,"Interesting, yeah. Do they give like specific line feedback? Or do they usually just give sort of&#8212;",correspondence;revision,,
,,Ron does.,correspondence;revision,,
,,OK.,correspondence;revision,,
,,"I mean, it all&#8212;I could show you. This, I guess, is the kind of&#8212;my screen is dirty&#8212;kind of thing you might want to see.",correspondence;revision,,
,,"So, let me go to my ""Mail,"" and I'll go to my&#8212;",correspondence;revision,,
,,Sure.,correspondence;revision,,
,,"&#8212;""Sent Mail,"" and you can see some of these.",correspondence;revision,,
,,"Oh, this actually has to do with the internet.",correspondence;revision,,
,,"I sent Ron a poem that mentions messages I was getting&#8212;it's actually in a poem from mileage.com&#8212;that I thought were funny. Well, so, Ron writes back. He said, ""Not sure you need the Q and A at the end""&#8212;I had a sort of ""interviewing myself"" bit at the end&#8212;""Not sure you need the Q and A at the end, but other than the problems with the url""&#8212;he thought that since I was saying Mileage.com, which he says is a phishing site &#8212;he thought that, if that was ever published in an online journal, and somebody hit on it, clicked it, that I could be in trouble for that, which I don't know if that's true. He says, ""You know that mileage.com is a phishing site. It sends malware to your PC if you follow through."" And then I, at some point, wrote back. I said, ""I don't do that.""",correspondence;revision,,
,,"So, you know, that's just some of the kinds of&#8212;so there I am, there I am sending something to him and having a correspondence with him.",correspondence;revision,,
,,Let's see.,,,
,,"Here I am sending something to myself, just to kind of preserve it. Same poem but it has a different title with that point&#8212;there is mileage.com lit up.",,,
,,"Oh, yeah!",,,
,,"Yeah, because it lights up if you&#8212;it doesn't on my computer, but it does if you do it on the iPad.",,,
,,It does it in Apple.,,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,," Right! So, did you write that on your iPad?",,,
,,"Well, like always, I started here and I moved it to the iPad, and then I moved it to the computer&#8212;-but I was sending&#8212;I think I start writing&#8212;usually, I write in the morning, sitting over there. And I don't want to be running up and down the stairs, so then after I'll just go, ""You know, this looks good enough to kind of type."" So, I'll type it here. And if I don't yet feel like sharing it with someone, I'll just send it to myself because that's a way of saving it.",prompt;revision;highlight,,
,,And that's when you could move it to your&#8212;,prompt;revision;highlight,,
,,Yeah,prompt;revision;highlight,,
,,&#8212;other computer?,prompt;revision;highlight,,
,,Uh-hmm.,prompt;revision;highlight,,
,,And so when did you start using the iPad?,prompt;revision;highlight,,
,,"Gee, again, I got an iPhone maybe three years ago, and I got the iPad maybe two years ago. I don't know. Time's a blur.",prompt;revision;highlight,,1567
,,Okay. So&#8212;,,,
,,"It's an old one, though.",,,
,,"So it's been a couple years, two or three years. Did you ever work on the iPhone, too?",,,
,,"No, too tiny.",,,
,,Too small of a typing format.,,,
,,"So then, back to the revision correspondence. Do you think that&#8212;why do you think that Ron Silliman (30:29) has kind of been the constant of all that?",correspondence;revision,,
,,"Well, because he's very confident about what he says, first of all, and he's also very specific. He doesn't always say why he thinks what he thinks, which drives me crazy, but he gives me something to bounce off.",correspondence;revision,,1833
,,"Yeah, and is he very prompt in responding?",correspondence;revision,,
,,"Often. Not always. Sometimes it's right away, sometimes it's not for days, depends on how busy he is.",correspondence;revision,,
,,"Yeah, and does he reciprocate? Does he send you things over?",correspondence;revision,,
,,He never has. He doesn't like to do that. Other people have.,correspondence;revision,,
,,"So, you know, that's fine with me, but&#8212;he writes really, really long, kind of book-length things, and he doesn't revise much. He doesn't revise like I do. He just has a different kind of practice, and he seems to be very invested in his own certainty about things more than I am. But some other people will send me things. Lydia Davis sends me things and Fanny Howe (31:25) once in awhile sends me things.",correspondence;revision,,
,,"And how did you kind of develop your revision process, from the beginning, I guess?",revision;highlight,,
,,"Well, I guess, I was just always looking for the best word, for instance, and it didn't always come to me right away. But also I will just get parts of things and I know that they're not finished, you know, and then I just try to see what can connect and I'll go one way, one direction and try to connect, you know, B to A. And then B doesn't quite connect to A, so then I'll go on to C and see if that connects to A.",revision;highlight,,
,,And has that been pretty constant throughout?,,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,,OK.,,,
,,Have there been any big changes in the way you've approached kind of pushing the poem to its finished state throughout the time?,change;revision,,
,,"Well, I bet there have, but you know, I was as much of a stranger to my twenty-four year-old self as you are, almost.",change;revision,,
,,"Well, you did mention, though, that with the internet and with email becoming more&#8212;giving more easily available correspondence&#8212;you did start to speed up in the work. And do you think that's the only reason, or do you think it also has something to do with maybe moving onto more of a national scene?",change;revision,,
,,"It could be that. It could be knowing that I have a supporting publisher. It could be just practice, you know, just that I have a better idea of what works now, you know&#8212;what works for me.",change;revision,,
,,Yeah.,change;revision,,1747
,,"And I know you don't&#8212;I think in one of your other interviews you said you don't really have, like, any intentions in revising your work, but are there primary things for different pieces that you're driven by? Like, are some driven more by sound, some driven more by meaning, some driven more by connecting the parts to the whole or disconnecting the parts to the whole?",change;revision,,
,,"All of those things equally, you know. I mean, I am very interested in sound, and sounds&#8212;certain sounds can really bother me, or I could get stuck on one certain sound. So yeah, meaning is important to me, too. In terms of connecting parts because, as you know, if you've looked at my work, it often&#8212;",change;revision,,
,,&#8212;in sections?,change;revision,,
,,&#8212;in sections.,change;revision,,
,,"Yeah, absolutely.",change;revision,,
,,"And so, the sections might be written on different days; often are. And they often come from different sources or different inspirations, and&#8212;so then, the question is how they link in. And you kind of&#8212;at least if you're me, I shouldn't say ""you"", but ""I""&#8212;want there to be some kind of possible perceptible connection, but I also want it to be surprising. I want it to kind of go somewhere that you didn't expect it to go, or that I didn't expect it to go. So, sometimes the first thing I come up with is too obvious and sometimes what I come up with is too random. It's like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.",change;revision;highlight,,
,,"Has that sort of looking for that surprising turn, or idea, been a constant throughout? I mean, has that been something that's been driving you since you started writing?",change;revision;highlight,,
,,"I've probably become more conscious of it, but I think so, yeah.",change;revision;highlight,,
,,"And how do&#8212;so, could you talk a little bit about how, as you say, a lot of your poems are in sections and how those sections kind of come to be a whole? I mean, could there be several different days, and then in between those different sections become different poems?",change;revision;highlight,,
,,"Sometimes that happens, yeah. I mean&#8212;",change;revision;highlight,,1867
,,Is it just a&#8212;do you just start to see connections? Does it&#8212;?,change;revision;highlight,,
,,"Yeah, and sometimes I have an idea of what I want vaguely, but I don't know exactly where I'm going to get it or what the specifics are. But I&#8212;sometimes I have just a gut feeling about the direction that I want to go, and other times I don't, and then I just have to be surprised and just know that I want something and should keep my eyes open for it.",change;revision;highlight,,
,,"And do you&#8212;I mean, there's a certain point where you say within the emails that you get some sort of affirmation. But then personally, when do you feel like a sense of, ""Oh! That's surprising!"" Is there like an ""Aha!"" moment?",change;revision;highlight,,
,,"Yeah, sure.",change;revision;highlight,,
,,"Yeah, you have to please yourself first.",change;revision;highlight,,
,,Yeah.,change;revision;highlight,,
,,"And I think one reason that I tend to send poems out is that I will be dissatisfied and fool with things forever unless somebody goes, ""Hey, that's good.""",change;revision;highlight,,
,,Yeah.,change;revision;highlight,,
,,"I mean, I'll go, ""Maybe it's not good. Maybe I should do something else."" So, you know, I think that's why I need somebody to give me a kind of endpoint and say, ""Cut it out now.""",change;revision;highlight,,
,,Yeah.,change;revision;highlight,,
,,"I mean, sometimes I know, but sometimes I can be insecure and just fiddle.",change;revision;highlight,,
,,"Right. And then I guess is there any way&#8212;do you, once the poem kind of reaches the thesis binder stage, is there any time that you start to see the ways those are working and go back and revise there? Or once it's there it's usually kind of off limits?",revision;mss,,
,,"Well, I wouldn't say it's off limits, but I don't usually revise them, but I have. I mean it has happened that I've suddenly seen how something could be better and, you know, gone away from it, gone back to it and went, ""Oh that could be better.""",revision;mss,,
,,"But I would say that's, you know, maybe one time in twenty.",,,
,,So they're more rare.,,,
,,Yeah.,,,1985
,,And when did you start using the thesis binders?,early;paper;mss,,
,,"Long time ago&#8212;maybe twenty, twenty-five years ago. They used to be easy to find, but now, like I said, they're antique&#8212;old school.",early;paper;mss,,
,,"Yeah, and before, when you were first putting your first collections together, how did that work? How was that looking?",early;paper;mss,,
,,"I might have had one even then. Because everyone used to. This is what used to happen. People&#8212;everyone used to bring these to a reading and just read from them. I don't even do that anymore because they're too heavy to carry. I just print them out. But that's what people used to do, so, everyone had one.",early;paper;mss,,
,,OK.,,,
,,So we've talked about how the other people&#8212;,,,
,,"Is there any other role that other people play in the process of your revisions? Are there any other people that are important to those, to the kind of finding the finish pieces?",,,
,,"Well, I think not really except sometimes my editor gives me a little bit of guidance&#8212;not about individual poems but about the order of poems within the manuscript. I usually think I know, but sometimes she has a different idea that she runs by me and we consider that.",,,
,,OK.,,,
,,"And then, sort of moving on to the organizational&#8212; what I call organizational/archival&#8212;and we've kind of covered some of this, but when you were first&#8212;so in the early days before the computers, when you kind of hit that, what would you say a final piece is? You'd send it out, would you also keep a printed page?",,,
,,"Oh, sure.",,,
,,OK.,,,
,,And that would be in&#8212;,,,
,,In thesis binders.,,,
,,&#8212;and how would you communicate with your publisher with those?,,,
,,"I suppose we had to communicate by snail mail, how else was there?",,,
,,"Right, and so you would collect those all&#8212;would you make a copy of it before you send it off?",,,2085
,,"Oh, yeah. I probably Xeroxed it. I mean, there were Xerox machines.",,,
,,"Yeah, OK.",,,
,,"And once things were published, and things, did you start to kind of keep an archive&#8212;and archive of your work at that point? I mean, did you have boxes with your papers in it even at the beginning, or did that start to come more gradually?",,,
,,"That came more gradually. I mean, I wish that I had kept my letters right from the beginning, because I had letters from George Oppen (39:10) and I had letter from Robert Creeley (39:12). It really took me awhile to realize that this was going to be worth anything.",future,,
,,Yeah.,future,,
,,"It took seeing some of my friend&#8212;the way some of my friends took it seriously, like Lyn Hejinian (39:27), and organized things, and treated it as if it was all worthwhile.",future,,
,,Yeah.,future,,
,,"But I didn't, you know, I didn't come from an intellectual family or background, and so it wasn't natural really for me, and I had to learn it.",future,,
,,"I'm interested in that, and like how did&#8212;so, the lessons were just from watching them do that, or were they from the conversations? I mean, did you just sort of notice that Lyn Hejinian (40:00) sort of had, like, kept things better?",future;highlight,,2167
,,"Well, I think at some point she sold her papers and I went, ""Oh, people sell their papers and they get money."" And also I would notice that she wrote letters as if she was writing for an archive. I mean, she would kind of give you the back story that you already knew, and I'm going, ""What? Who is she talking to?"" The archive!",future;highlight,,
,,"I never thought of that as being one of the correspondents, but that's a good point.",future;highlight,,
,,"Yeah, and so, I guess&#8212;",future;highlight,,
,,"I still don't do that. But I think email has pretty much ended that for most people. Now, people just shoot off emails and so I don't know what's happening to archives.",future;highlight,,
,,"Yeah, I know, right? I mean, is there any way you try to save your emails? Are there any that you&#8212;?",future;highlight,,
,,"I have saved emails, and even printed them out and given them to libraries, but I just&#8212;I think Ron saves everything. So, everything I send to him gets saved. That's how I look at it. He's my archivist.",future;highlight,,
,,"I mean, I only&#8212;you know, there's only so much space in my house.",future;highlight,,
,,"Oh, yeah.",future;highlight,,
,,"I know you can save things on your hard drive and give your hard drive to a library, but God knows what's on my hard drive. So, so far I've just&#8212;what I do now is, if there's anything that seems especially interesting or valuable, I'll print it out and keep it.",future;highlight,,
,,"And did you&#8212;like when you first started writing the emails back and forth, and kind of like general correspondence, what was the sort of tenor of those? Did it still feel more like a letter? I mean, did you notice a gradual change?",,,
,,"Yeah. I mean, sure, letters were letters and&#8212;I should go look up my old letters. I could go to an archive and look at them.",,,
,,"Yeah, I think you would talk about various things&#8212;how your life was going and then you would say, ""And by the way I wrote this"" include it&#8212;but you would be catching up. Sure, now we catch up all the time, you know.",,,
,,"Right, so, kind of constantly. Are you on any social media things?",,,
,,I'm on Facebook.,,,
,,You do Facebook.,,,
,,"And I'm also on Twitter, but I don't tweet much.",,,
,,Just follow whatever's going on?,,,
,,"A few things, yeah.",,,
,,A little bit?,,,
,,"Yeah, but sure, I'm on Facebook and that's how I get some of my news.",,,
,,"Yeah, yeah.",,,
,,"Do you remember your first email? Or any of that sort of thing? Sort of nostalgic, but&#8212;?",,,
,,"I don't remember my first email. I remember that Ron said that I had ""ramped up quickly."" That was flattering, so I remember it.",,,
,,Were you first given an email because of your work&#8212;because of UCSD? Was that your first?,,,2318
,,"No, I got it on my own and when my son was still living here, and he helped me set everything up. I mean, you know, he was probably fourteen or something. So that's why I have a really stupid&#8212;I mean, my university address&#8212;I guess you wrote me at my university address? Or did you write me&#8212;?",,,
,,"Yeah, I think both. You gave me the other one because you were traveling.",,,
,,"Which is really stupid because it's ""RAEA100900."" I shouldn't say that anything my son said was stupid, but he was only about fourteen and I guess he thought that was&#8212;I feel like I'm James Bond or something with that email address, but whatever.",,,
,,Let me see here&#8212;,,,
,,"So, I mean, it seems to me like, in sort of talking about the progression, that the main difference&#8212;the main change&#8212;has really just been the kind of speed with which email allows you to kind of get to a point where you think things are solid enough for a collection.",change;highlight,,
,,Yeah,change;highlight,,
,,"Is there anything else you can think of that really changed as technology changed, or do you feel like for the most part&#8212;not that the type writer and computer are the same&#8212;but that the relationship between the notebook and those sort of typing procedures were similar?",change;highlight,,
,,"Well, I was never a great typist, so I was always making mistakes. So, it was always frustrating. Of course sometimes I hate my computer, too. I mean, it's not a question of the typing issue, but just&#8212;you know, we all hate our computers.",change;highlight,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,,"They're slow. Whatever. Sometimes I'm yelling at my computer, ""What did you just do?"" You know, it'll lose a document and I'll go, ""What? I did what? It's gone!"" You know?",,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,,"So, I have kind of an adversarial relationship with it, but I use it all the time.",,,
,,"And if you lost something, then you would go back&#8212;what would be your first move?",,,
,,"Well, supposedly you can hit&#8212;I think it's CTRL-X&#8212;and get it back, but that doesn't work very well for me.",,,
,,Would you go back to an email? I mean like if you&#8212;?,,,
,,"Well, if I sent an email, sure.",,,
,,"What does the revision, if it's just you on your upstairs computer, what does that revision look like? I mean, are you moving things around a lot or are you&#8212;is it more just sort of reading and then deleting and inserting new words?",revision,,
,,"Yeah, that would be it.",revision,,
,,Mostly. Do you read them out loud to yourself?,revision,,
,,"Yeah, always.",revision,,2467
,,OK.,revision,,
,,When do you start doing that?,revision,,
,,In the notebook.,revision,,
,,"In the notebook. And so&#8212;well, can you talk a little bit more about how that works? I mean, is it something that as you're writing the first line, you're reading out loud, or is it like you finish something?",revision,,
,,"I probably&#8212;well, in between&#8212;not the first line, but I'd probably have to have a few lines before I thought it was worth reading them out loud.",revision,,
,,Let's see...,,,
,,"I should get to something bad that changed a lot, but then that would be embarrassing.",,,
,,"We're only being recorded by like four devices, so&#8212;",,,
,,"Yeah, right.",,,
,,I don't know what to do here because the things that I start out writing change so much.,,,
,,Let's see.,,,
,,"I can get to a poem that's finished, and I can read a little bit from my journal that were the beginning of it, I guess.",,,2527
,,"OK, yeah, that'd be great.",,,
,,"OK, although the beginning is going to be very bad&#8212;",,,
,,Give the rest of us hope!,,,
,,&#8212;you can stand that. OK.,,,
,,"So, this is in two parts, and I think this part is working on&#8212;first of all, it's very hard to read my hand writing, even for me to read it when I'm looking back at something I wrote a while ago now.",,,
,,That's bad.,,,
,,"OK, there is&#8212;is it okay if I read the poem, or is that a waste of time?",,,
,,No! Absolutely.,,,
,,"OK, so, this is called ""Particular:""",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"Rough, squat, bent, crabbed, cranky. A cranky person who is over enthusiastic about a particular topic. To be particular is to be choosy. A particle is a body whose extent and internal structure, if any, are irrelevant. You there, let's dispense with these properties of matter such anachronistic clothes as ghosts wear. Let's be mirrors, facing mirrors. Fall in love.",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"OK, so, here's some build up to that, which really doesn't sound like a poem at all. OK, this is embarrassing but:",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"To love, you show yourself willing to erase yourself. Make yourself blank together for a few moments&#8212;see, this is just prose&#8212;""in order to reflect the other."" That ended up being, ""Let's be mirrors facing mirrors. Fall in love.""",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"Two cloudless skies, no earth between. The young do it best, now everyone has lost the trick of it. For love, they emptied&#8212;",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,&#8212;and then I guess I'm rewriting:,highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"For love, they emptied themselves. Mirrors reflecting mirrors.",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"So, that gets a bit of that.",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"The young, two cloudless skies, nothing between. Not like us, condensed into these peculiar shapes. For love they emptied themselves&#8212;",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,&#8212;and this is starting over again:,highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"&#8212;""until they're mirrors reflecting mirrors. The young unlike us, who have assumed these peculiar shapes, they forget everything until they're mirrors reflecting mirrors, the young open channels""&#8212;",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,&#8212;I took that out eventually,highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"&#8212;""through which charges flow, not us. They forget everything until they're mirrors reflecting mirrors, they fall in love. The trick young can do, unlike us with our definite opinions and habits, these properties and mass change, spin""&#8212;",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"&#8212;so that gets to where I was talking about a particle is a body. So that's like subatomic, right?",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"&#8212;""its extended internal structure, if any are irrelevant, let's dispense with these properties of matter.""",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"So anyway, here I'm starting to get in to that. ""These properties and mass charge spin are like the clothes that ghosts wear."" Well, that gets in to here, except there's no simile. It just goes:",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,Let's dispense with these properties of matter. Such anachronistic clothes as ghosts wear. Let's be mirrors facing mirrors.,highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,You can see how some of that worked into that.,highlight;prompt;revision,,2735
,,"Yeah, absolutely! And then&#8212;so, it kind of moves, not quite chronologically, but sequentially, and it's not even a winnowing; it's an addition and subtraction, and addition&#8212;",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,Now this is stuff not even Ron Silliman sees because I wouldn't send anything that inchoate to anyone.,highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,OK.,highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"So, now, you're seeing something, you're hearing something, that nobody has&#8212;",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"Yeah. No, it's fascinating. And then so, at a certain point when you move to that, does that sort of stop in the journal, in the notebook?",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,Yeah.,highlight;prompt;revision,,2767
,,"I mean, in the next poem?",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"Once I move to this, then I seldom go back to the notebook.",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"OK. But then the next page, then, would be the next poem that you work on, essentially?",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"Yeah, unless I decide that, say, the last part of this is bad and then I might start over in the notebook.",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"And so the type of revision, then, that happens on the iPad&#8212;? I mean, it's not as easy to kind of move things around there. What usually occurs?",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,"Fortunately for me my poems don't have a lot of words and they have short lines, so I just back things out and start over. I just do that.",highlight;prompt;revision,,
,,OK.,,,
,,"Is there any sort of formatting that you use, either here or on your PC, that you kind of developed? Like do you have a certain font that you use or anything like that, or is that not really a concern of yours?",,,
,,That's not really a concern.,,,
,,OK.,,,
,,"I mean, I wouldn't want to hate a font but I'm okay with the standard font.",,,
,,"Yeah. And then I guess I'm wondering, then, before there were&#8212;before you had the iPad&#8212;you would just take the notebook up to your computer and write it down there?",,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,,That would be the thing?,,,
,,"Sure, of course.",,,
,,"So, it's almost like an ease of place, almost.",,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,,More than anything else.,,,
,,"Absolutely, because I'm just comfortable in this room and I would just stay there with my coffee playing around here for quite a while. So, I think that's just, you know, habit.",,,2851
,,"Yeah, yeah.",,,
,,"Do you use the&#8212;when you're connected up there, is the internet always connected as well? Are you always connected to the internet?",,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,,"Are you doing any, are you using it for research purposes or reference purposes when you're up there?",,,
,,"Yeah, I mean in terms of my teaching&#8212;",,,
,,OK.,,,
,,"&#8212;because I'm preparing to teach this class I've never taught before, and I'm going to be teaching it with a guy, with a physicist, where it's called Poetry for Physicists&#8212;",,,
,,That's great!,,,
,,"&#8212;and he's been getting a lot press lately. I don't know if you've seen it. Bryan Keating (52:01), he was involved with the discovery at the South Pole?",,,
,,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely!",,,
,,"Yeah, yeah.",,,
,,"Oh, wow!",,,
,,And he's interested in poetry!,,,
,,"So anyway, I'm doing research for that, and I was just&#8212;I'm using some ancient poets like Lucretius, who wrote about science, you know. I mean, he wrote&#8212;the ancient Greeks like Lucretius knew about&#8212;or, not knew but hypothesized the existence of atoms and the void. So, I was just doing some research about him on the computer and then printing them out.",,,
,,"Yeah, so, sure.",,,
,,"Yeah, I know. When I was reading your work and read about those kinds of things&#8212;discovery or confirmation of the Inflation Theory, I was like, ""I would really like to see a poem by Rae Armantrout about this.""",,,
,,"Well, turns out he's my bud!",,,
,,"Yeah, that's awesome! Yeah, that's a good&#8212;and how long have you been in conversation with him?",,,
,,"I dedicated a poem to him in this book. So, I've been in conversation with him for, I don't know, maybe three years? So the poem called ""Accounts"" is based on a conversation that we had.",,,
,,And what are his books?,,,
,,"Here it is. See? ""For Bryan Keating."" (53:18)",,,
,,"Oh, cool! OK.",,,
,,"I don't think scientists&#8212;I mean, he's an astrophysicist. They don't write books.",,,
,,"You mentioned somebody that&#8212;there was some, like, more popular science writer that you were reading&#8212;?",,,
,,"You know I read Brian Greene, different Brian&#8212;",,,
,,"Yeah, I was getting confused because of the Brian's.",,,
,,And how long has that been a sort of subject of fascination for you?,,,
,,"I think&#8212;the first time I did anything with particle physics was really when it first became popularized, like when The Tao of Physics came out in the 80's. And at first I thought it was just kind of absurd, all the particles, and I thought it was just like, ""How many angels can stamd on the head of a pin?"" or whatever. But I was still reading it and sort of interested in it, and then I guess starting with my book Up To Speed in 2004, I've taken a more sustained interest in it.",,,
,,What's this class going to look like overall? Do you have like a shape to it?,,,
,,"Yeah. I mean, I've never team-taught before, but some days I'll be talking&#8212;I've chosen poems that either have something to do with cosmology or physics in some way, or that have to do with objectivity and subjectivity and theories of mind. Or then, in a different way, going off of kind of Chaos Theory where complexity can be&#8212;can grow from the iteration of simple rules. I'm using some poets like,",,,
,,"well, like Ron Silliman, and like Jackson Macklow (55:01), and like Christian Bök, that (Indiscernible, 55:05) poet who use constraints, or rules, to generate poems and have math in their poems, you know, not as a subject but as a generative principle.",,,3067
,,Right.,,,
,,So I'm doing some of that.,,,
,,"And Brian is, you know, he likes poetry but he's not exactly up to the avant-garde, shall we say? He likes sonnets and such, so we have a bit of that.",,,
,,"OK, and will it be a class in which you ask the students to write, or is it more&#8212;?",,,
,,It's not really a writing class.,,,
,,&#8212;survey?,,,
,,"I mean, they're going to write one poem and they're going to write a couple of essays and there's going to be a couple of tests, and it's mostly a reading and discussion course.",,,
,,"OK, and its next fall?",,,
,,"No, it's in the spring. It starts in a week.",,,
,,"Oh, right!",,,
,,It starts next Tuesday.,,,
,,You guys are quarters.,,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,,OK.,,,
,,"So, let me see here.",,,
,,"We're fairly well along, almost done actually.",,,
,,"Are there any other&#8212;I mean, these are kind of&#8212;I don't know how far you want to get in to this, but in terms of teaching, when did that sort of email and computer start to kind of take over that? I mean, sort of like the 2000's, early 2000's?",,,
,,"Email? I think that was in the 90's, wasn't it?",,,
,,"Yeah, yeah.",,,
,,And has that&#8212;do you feel like that's changed how you approach students and how you approach your classes?,,,
,,"Well, yeah. Now your students can always find you. It certainly made it easier to write a syllabus having a computer&#8212;",,,
,,Yeah,,,
,,"&#8212;and, you know, you can constantly email your students and remind them of what they're supposed to be doing. I think its just made things easier for everyone.",,,
,,"Do you see any sort of differences in understanding of your students now as to your students like, say, fifteen or twenty years ago?",,,
,,"Well, I think that, you know, certainly students do gradually change. I think that when you teach young people, you kind of, sort of stay in that world. You hear their expressions&#8212;I'm not saying I'm a digital native by a long shot&#8212;but you know, you sort of hear the way they talk and you get a bit of their mind set, and you know, you know their lingo. In a way that, I think, when I retire, I might miss that.",,,
,,"Yeah, yeah.",,,
,,"But still, if something goes wrong with my computer I have to get my son to help me.",,,
,,"So, that's actually&#8212;I've found that this has been kind of a theme. Do you have somebody who comes in and helps you if you have any computer problems?",,,
,,"Yeah, he lives in Seattle, but he's walked me through things on the phone.",,,
,,OK.,,,
,,And has he set up&#8212;did he set up your computer when you first got it and stuff like that?,,,
,,Yeah.,,,
,,OK.,,,
,,"And he was 14. He's built a computer, even.",,,
,,"Oh, is he working&#8212;if he's in Seattle, is he working in the computer industry?",,,
,,"No, he's a scientist but he's not in the computer industry. He's a biologist.",,,
,,"Oh, OK.",,,
,,"So, I'm fairly well through. We've covered pretty much what I liked to cover. I do have my blunt questions at the end. So, is there any sort of overarching thing that you think has changed with the advent of computers in terms of writing? I mean, do you see a sort of maybe change in tone, a change in tenor, a change in ideas that have been&#8212;?",change,,
,,"Well, yeah. I mean, the fact that I've just recently wrote a poem that references Mileage.com&#8212;",change,,
,,Right.,,,
,,"&#8212;and if I could bring up that section of it for you, anyway, because it's certainly something that would not have been written had there not been computers. It goes: ""Protect your identities says mileage.com, three times today as if it knew something. I may want to fly cheap, cruise in luxury, buy a walk-in tub, and burial insurance.""",,,
,,"Yeah, they try to sell you things.",,,
,,"So yeah, I mean, I think that that gets into the content of the work, and then there are groups of poets who work in that realm kind of specifically and almost exclusively&#8212;like the Flarf poets, for instance, just do what they call ""Google mining.""",,,
,,"Yeah, and what's&#8212;what do you&#8212;",,,
,,"And also of course, there are digital poets. There's digital poetry where people write poems especially for the computer, where the&#8212;I don't know, the words fall off the screen at different rates, and such.",,,
,,"Yeah, do you do&#8212;if you were willing to be reading poems for whatever reason, do you find that you're reading them a lot more on your screen than you used to?",,,
,,"I don't like to read on the screen. I mean, I do read things on the screen, but if I'm judging a contest or something, which I sometimes do, I ask for hard copies. Or if I get them on the screen, I print them because I just don't like to read on the screen. I mean, I don't want to sit up there on a hard chair. I don't want to look at that light&#8212;",printdig,,3367
,,Right.,,,
,,You know?,,,
,,"No, I think that's pretty typical.",,,
,,"OK, I think that's good, Rae.",,,
,,Thank you very much.,,,
,,"Alright, this was painless.",,,
,,Yeah! Alright.,,,
,,Just at an hour.,,,
,,Good.,,,
,,Good.,,,
